# Revenue-analysis-project
In this project I`m analyzing movie data, doing feature engineering and predicting films revenue. One can find a lot of infographics and implementation of classic ML algorithms (and catboost) here.
In this project I cleaned movie data, did a preliminary research on it, added additional relevant features and implemented 3 ML approaches to predict revenue.
